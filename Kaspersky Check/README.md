## About
The script connects to each machine specified in `hosts.txt` and checks if AnyDesk is already installed on this machine

The script expects `hosts.txt` to have FQDNs of each machine (e.g SQL-SERV01.DOMAIN.LOCAL)

`PsExec64.exe` and `hosts.txt` should be in the same directory

## Synxtax 
1) Execute the script
   `.\anydesk.ps1`
